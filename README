assetmgr - Asset Management System
copyright (c) 2008 Kentfield School District

This is an attempt to combine a hardware and software asset management system
together with a trouble ticket system, and link data to an (externally 
maintained) inventory system and two Mac-specific data systems: the
postgresql data contained in Apple Remote Desktop 2/3, and the NetRestore
imaging system developed by Mike Bombich, which can use the xml resources
provided by this system to select and control the network imaging process.

For information on Apple Remote Desktop's postgresql data, see:
http://developer.apple.com/appleapplications/ardsql.html

For more information on Mike Bombich's NetRestore's PHP services system
(which this system supplants), see:
http://www.bombich.com/software/docs/NetRestore%20PHPServices/index.html

The trouble ticket system is modeled after MyTechDesk.  See:
