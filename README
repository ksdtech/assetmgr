assetmgr - Asset Management System
copyright (c) 2008 Kentfield School District

This is an attempt to combine a hardware and software asset management system
together with a trouble ticket system, and link data to an (externally 
maintained) inventory system and two Mac-specific data systems: the
postgresql data contained in Apple Remote Desktop 2/3, and the NetRestore
imaging system developed by Mike Bombich, which can use the xml resources
provided by this system to select and control the network imaging process.

Dependencies:
  faster_csv gem for parsing import files
  will_paginate gem for pagination in Rails 2.0
  snmp for polling printer page counts

Newly added: SNMP support for a daily rake task to pull printer page count
information for printer that support RFC 1759 (Printer-MIB).  
I will probably add more SNMP calls to monitor network switches.  Also
on the horizon is support for monitoring other periodic tasks, such as server
processes and backup status.

For information on Apple Remote Desktop's postgresql data, see:

For more information on Mike Bombich's NetRestore's PHP services system
(which this system supplants), see:

The trouble ticket system is modeled after MyTechDesk.  See:
