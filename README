assetmgr - Asset Management System
copyright (c) 2008 Kentfield School District

This is an attempt to combine a hardware and software asset management system
together with a trouble ticket system, and link data to an (externally 
maintained) inventory system and two Mac-specific data systems: the
postgresql data contained in Apple Remote Desktop 2/3, and the NetRestore
imaging system developed by Mike Bombich, which can use the xml resources
provided by this system to select and control the network imaging process.
